# Setup

To run this app you are going to need an Giphy API Key. You can get one at the [Developer Dashboard](https://developers.giphy.com/dashboard/).

Create a new plist file called `APIKey.plist` at the root of the App Bundle and create a single String property `APIKey` with your freshly generated API Key.
